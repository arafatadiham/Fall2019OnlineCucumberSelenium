    This is a java/maven project, that we are using for UI test automation.
    Selenium Webdriver is used to interact with a browser.
    It’s a hybrid test automation framework because we’re using data driven and behavior driven frameworks at the same time.
    For storing locators we are following page object model.
    Basically, we create corresponding page classes for every page of our application.
    To develop test scenarios we use Cucumber BDD and every single test is written from end-user perspective.
    We have a base page class that is used as a super class for all page classes.
    It contains all common locators and initializes page factory. Also ,we have a utilities package were we keep all reusable code.
    To run tests, we just simply trigger cucumber runner class. For regression suite and smoke test we have a dedicated maven profiles.
    As a reporting tool we use maven-cucumber reporting plugin. For remote test execution we use Selenium Grid and couple of virtual machines.
    We use git as a version control system and GitHub as a remote repository.
